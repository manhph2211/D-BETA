## :rocket: Introduction

**What about an ECG signal foundation model?**

Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for an estimated 17.9 million deaths annually, which is about 32% of all global deaths. Electrocardiograms (ECGs) play a crucial role in diagnosing these conditions, with over 300 million ECGs performed each year globally.

Despite the widespread use of ECGs, there's a lack of general-purpose models that can effectively interpret ECG data across diverse populations and conditions. Our work presents D-BETA, a new approach that learns directly from both ECG signals and their relevant textual reports simultaneously without needing exact manual labels. D-BETA not only captures subtle details in each type of data but also learns how they connect, helping it make a better foundation model with more accurate decisions.

Across comprehensive evaluation, D-BETA consistently outperforms strong baselines on 100+ cardiac conditions, offering a scalable, self-supervised path toward accurate, label-efficient heart health AI worldwide.

This repo provides a quick example of running D-BETA with a zero-shot experiment on CODE-15 test dataset. It is structured as follows:

```angular2html
.
├── configs
│   ├── config.json
├── data
│   ├── pretrain
│   ├── downstream
│   │   ├── code-test
│   │   │   └── data
│   │           ├── annotations
│   │           ├── ecg_tracings.hdf5
├── models
│   ├── modules
│   └── dbeta.py
└── infer.ipynb
└── README.md

```

## :book: Usage

First, we need to clone the project and prepare the environment as follows:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/manhph2211/D-BETA.git && cd D-BETA
conda create -n dbeta python=3.9
conda activate dbeta
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Next, please download the CODE-test data from [here](https://zenodo.org/records/3765780) and put it into the `data/downstream/code-test` directory. 

Then, we need to download the pre-trained model from [here](https://huggingface.co/Manhph2211/D-BETA), and put it into `checkpoints` directory.

Finally, to run the code, we can just use the `example.ipynb` notebook.
